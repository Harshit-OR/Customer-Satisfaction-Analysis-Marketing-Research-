Overview:
This project analyzes customer satisfaction toward the Tata Nexon, a popular SUV in India, using primary survey data collected from over 350+ customers. The goal is to identify key satisfaction drivers and suggest actionable improvements for the brand, especially in areas like pricing, design, fuel efficiency, and after-sales service.

Objectives:
To evaluate customer satisfaction across key performance indicators (KPIs).
To identify major factors influencing overall satisfaction.
To provide data-backed recommendations to enhance customer experience.

Data Collection:
A structured survey was created using Google Forms.
Data was collected from 350+ Tata Nexon owners across various demographics (age, income, region, usage duration).
The questionnaire included Likert scale ratings and categorical responses.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – for data wrangling and visualizations
SPSS – for factor analysis and descriptive statistics
MS Excel – for cleaning, filtering, and summary tables
Google Forms – for survey design and collection

Analysis Performed:
Data Cleaning: Removed nulls, standardized categories, and verified response validity.
Descriptive Statistics: Mean ratings, standard deviations, frequency distributions.
Factor Analysis: Conducted using SPSS to group correlated KPIs into factors (e.g., Design & Performance, Service Experience).
Visualization: Created charts to highlight satisfaction patterns.

Key Findings:
High satisfaction with design, safety features, and fuel efficiency.
Moderate to low satisfaction with after-sales service, including responsiveness and service center availability.
Customers in urban regions were generally more satisfied than those in semi-urban or rural areas.

Recommendations:
Strengthen the after-sales service network and training.
Leverage strong satisfaction in design/safety in marketing campaigns.
Introduce customer feedback loops post-service to improve engagement and retention.

Outcome:
Customer retention strategies
Product development alignment with customer needs
More targeted marketing and communication approaches
